## ships i do not want inting with me ✦

```python
. #sonamy - "but they're canon..!" i dont care.
. #shadouge - i dont see them getting romantically involved w/ eachother since Rouge is more interested in jewelry/gems/valuable items than relationships.
. #tails x cream/child (9 and below) x 10 and above - no, they're allowed to have crushes (in a **platonic** way.) on eachother although.
. #rouge x 17 and below - gross.
. #amy x 14 and above - "but they removed the ages!!" i dont care, she's still 12 whether you like it or not.
. #adult (19 and above) x child (13 and below) - no.
. #sonic x rouge - she's 18 and he's 15.  
```
